# Comments section

The project was carried out for educational purposes (React).\
Task taken from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-comments-section-iG1RugEG9/hub/interactive-comments-section-HB1buS6Z9).

### Actual links
- [on vercel](https://comments-section.jpee2k.vercel.app)
- [json-server api](https://api-comments-section.herokuapp.com)
- [about me](https://cv-jpee2k.vercel.app/)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run db`

Runs the local DB on port 3040.\
But by default uses third party [API](https://api-comments-section.herokuapp.com).

### `npm run eslint` && `npm run eslint-fix`

Runs the linter that checks source files for errors in the `/src` folder.

#### Technical task
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- Using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.
